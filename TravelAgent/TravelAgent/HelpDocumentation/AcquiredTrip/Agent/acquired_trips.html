      <h2>Understanding "Sold trips" Page</h2>
      <p>
        Sold trips page shows all of the trips tourist have either purchased or reserved, for each sold trip you can see 
        the departure location, departure time, destination location and arrival time. Purchased trip means that the tourist has already paid for the trip, whilst the reserved trip isn't paid for yet, we are keeping that ticket reserved and the tourist will pay at a later date.
